# Setting-up

# The project:
You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.
The board can be obtained two ways. The first one is by reading a file passed as the program’s
argument.

You program must print the board, with some “.” replaced by “x” to represent the largest square
you found.

If ever there are several solutions, you have to represent only the highest square. If they are
still several solutions, choose the square to the left.


# Generating your own:
The second way to obtain a board is to generate one based on given parameters. The parameters
will be a number, representing the width and height of the board, and a pattern that will be
repeated line by line along the board.
You will print the solved board.
